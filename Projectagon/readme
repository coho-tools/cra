This package is the core of CRA. It has two parts:
  Ph: Projectagon structures and its operations
  Forwad: Compute forward reachable regions given LDI models (see Integer pkg).  
## Ph packages
# We support three types of projectagons
ph_create       : create a general (non-convex) projectagon from polygons.
ph_createByLP   : create a convex projectagon from lps.
ph_createByBox  : create a bbox projectagon from  bounding box.
ph_rand         : generate a random projectagon (mainly for test purpose).
ph_convert      : convert the type of projectagons.
ph_get          : get structure info.
# operations
ph_isempty      : check if the projectagon is empty or not
ph_intersect    : intersection of two or more projectagons.
ph_union        : union of two or more projectagons
ph_intersectLP  : intersection of a projectagon and LP
ph_intersectLine: intersection of a projectagon and line 
                    (result is bloated to be a projectagon) 
ph_simplify     : simplify the projectagon.
ph_contain      : check if a projectagon contained by anoter one
ph_containPts   : check if points are contained by a projectagon
ph_project      : project a projectagon onto 2d subspaces
ph_canon        : make the projectagon canonical
ph_minkSum      : MinkSum operations (only support bbox now)
ph_chplanes     : change the project planes a projectagon
ph_promote      : promote a set of projectagons to have the same planes
ph_interval     : interval closure calculation
ph_regu         : make ill-conditioned projectagon a normal one 
# display
ph_display      : display a projectagon
ph_display3d    : display a 3D projectagon in 3D space
phs_display     : display a set of projectagon
# misc
ph_volumn       : volumn of a projectagon (based on random sampling)
ph_ratio        : ration of two projectagons (based on poly areas)
# move to CCW? 
ph_derivative   : compute the Brockett annulus of varaibles.
ph_derivativePt : compute the Brockett annulus based sampling points


## Forward packages
# options
ph_getOpt       : get default options
ph_checkOpt     : check if the option is correct 
ph_setOpt       : update the options
# forward
ph_advance      : the main function to compute advanced projectagons
ph_advanceSafe  : this function caches exceptions from ph_advance and 
                    try with different options to continue the computations. 
                    Exceptions may from over-approximation or computation error. 
# basic step
ph_smash        : break long edges and preprocess faces 
ph_face         : prepare the face to be advanced (used by ph_model)
ph_model        : create LDI modes for each face 
ph_timeStep     : compute the max time step given the bloat amount
ph_guess        : guesss a bloat amount and a time step
ph_forward      : forward the projectagon
ph_realBloatAmt : compute the real bloat amount (for guess-verify)
ph_verify       : verify the pair of (timeStep, bloatAmt) is valid
ph_construct    : construct the advanced projectagon
ph_succ         : compute the reachable tube during time [t1,t2]
