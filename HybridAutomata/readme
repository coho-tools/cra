This package provide an interface for reachability analysis. 

A hybrid automata is consist of: 
  Name: 
  States: For each automata state, the state name and dynamics are required. 
    The system dynamics is speicifed by a function of the interface: 
        ldi = modelFunc(lp)
      where lp is a Coho LP and ldi is a LDI model or a cell of models. 
    State invariants are used to specify the state invariant regions. 
      It is optional, but must be Coho LP if provided.
      Each invariant constraint defines a 'gate', which is used for transistion.
      During reachabilty computation, the intersection of reachable regions and 
      'gates' are computation, the intersection are used as initial regions for 
      other states. 
    User can use different projectagon configuration for each state. 
    User can provide functions to be called during reachability computation. 
      Ususally user need to provide a function for computation termination. 
      Another function to decide when to slice the reachable region by 'gates'. 
      Other functions can be called before/after reachable compuations, 
      before/after each computation steps. See ha_state.m for details. 
    There are two built-in types of states: 
      transistion state: the reachable region will leave the invariant region. 
        computation is terminated when rechable region leaves the invariant, 
        slicing is always performed. See ha_transState.m for details 
      stable state: the reachabe region will not leave the invariant region. 
        computation is terminated when reachable region convergesss, 
        slicing is only performance on the last step. See ha_stableState.m 
     
  Transistions: Transistion between automata states. 
    Source state and target state must be provided.
    The gate ID of the source state is zero by default. 
      The virtual gate 0 means the reachable regions for the source state are 
      used as initial regions of the target state. 
      Otherwise, the intersection of reachable regions and gate are used as 
      initial regions of the target state. 
    ResetMap is supported also to update the target initial regions. 
      ph = resetMap(ph); 

  Sources: Specify the source state, could be multiple states. Reachability 
    computation is performed from these states.

  Initial Regions: Initial regions of reach source state

  Invariant: Global invariant for the reachable regions.

The reachability computation is of the flow: 
  For each state
    % computation inital regions
    Find all source states by transistions
    Compute initial regions by transistion source and gates. 
    
    % Specify state dynamics 
    cra_cfg('set','modelFunc',state.modelFunc); 

    % Preform reachability computation
    state.beforeComp;                 % callback
    while(~state.exitCond) 
      prevPh = ph;
      state.beforeStep;               % callback
      ph = ph_advance(ph,state.phOpt) % compute forward reachable set
      tube = ph_succ(ph,prevPh);      % compute reachable tube 
      state.afterStep;                % callback
      if(state.sliceCond)
        state.slices = ph_intersect(tube,state.inv); % slice reachable tube
      end
    end    
    state.afterComp;                  % callback
  end
  % save all reachable data onto disk
