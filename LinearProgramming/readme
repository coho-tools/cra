This package provide linear program solvers and projection solvers. 
For both LP and projection, we provide a Java based solution. 
The Java solver is robust (using arbitration precesion rational numbers). 
To improve performance, we can use other solvers (e.g. matlab or cplex). 
If these solvers failed, we can use Java solver then.
We also have a matlab projection solver, but its overapproximation error may be huge. 

// Create a LP
  lp_create       : create a lp
  lp_createByBox  : create a lp from bounding box
  lp_createByHull : create a lp from convex hull
  lp_rand         : create a random lp

// Basic check
  lp_feasible     : check if the lp is feasible or not
  lp_isempty      : check if the lp is empty (no constraints)
  lp_norm         : check if the lp is a normal lp
  lp_iscoho       : check if the lp is coho (or dual) lp
  lp_sat          : check if a point satisfies the lp or not

// Get LP info
  lp_dims         : return dimensions of lp 
  lp_get          : get lp constraints values

// Set LP info and LP opertions
  lp_bloat        : bloat the lp outward 
  lp_operate      : perform operations on constraints
  lp_convert      : convert equality constraints to inequality constraints
  lp_unique       : remove redundant constraints
  lp_and          : intersection of two lps 
  lp_box          : compute bounding box of a lp
  lp_pickup       : project lp onto lower dimensions (over-approximation)

// LP solvers
  Solver/lp_opt   : lp solver interface
  Solver/lp_solve : various lp solvers impelmentation
  Solver/CPLEX    : package to call cplex solver

// Projection solvers
  Project/lp_project:  lp projection solver interface
  Project/lp_projectAsympt: matlab projection solver
  Project/lp_hulls:    functions for matlab solver
